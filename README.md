# Raytracer Project

![Example Image](image.ppm)

This project is a simple raytracer implemented in C++. It demonstrates basic concepts of ray tracing, including rendering spheres with surface normals and antialiasing.

## How to Run

1. **Build the Project:**

    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Raytracer:**

    ```sh
    make run_raytracer
    ./raytracer_weekend
    ```

This will generate an `image.ppm` file, which is a simple PPM image format that can be viewed with most image viewers.
